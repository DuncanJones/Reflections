When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are working with multiple people or across multiple machines / locations
When you want to share your work with others
As a way to back-up your work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Changes may be made to remote that you don't want on your local copy
This would be especially true if more than one person was working on the remote

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is a clone on the GitHub - I use this when I want to create a remote copy of a repository already on GitHub
Clone creates a copy of a repository - I use this when I want to create a copy of a repository on my machine but not share it
Branch creates a new branch in the repository already on my machine / the GitHub - I use this to work on two changes at once or to work on an idea away from my core project
